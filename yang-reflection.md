#GPS 1.1 Reflection 

* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

I think I had a good understanding of the Git concepts before the GPS. I really need to practice using Git commands so that they come more naturally (both in terms of integratnig the process into my own work flow and recalling the commands). Right now I'm still having to look back at the Git and GitHub workflow pages in Canvas. I'll be spending more time just practicing those commands so that I can work more efficiently. 

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

During the session I learned that git pull is actually a combination of git fetch and git merge. The three of us discussed why some developers prefer using the git pull command and why some developers use the git fetch then git merge commands. I also got clarification about when to use git pull (on your working directory) which was something I was trying to figure out during the day before we started pairing. 

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

I asked my guide and pair about feature branch naming conventions, most appropriate times for committing, when to use git pull, and clarifying questions about the instructions for the GPS.

* What still confuses you about Git?

I'm not really confused by the concepts we've covered so far. At a high level, I understand why merge conflicts arise. However, I'm not very quick at being able to think several steps ahead to predict when a merge conflict might come up yet. It's more like I understand why a conflict happened when I get the message in Terminal. I'm looking forward to learning more about resolving merge conflicts and reviewing code that other people have written. 

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

My first experience was wonderful. Our guide, Regina, answered questions thoughtfully and gave actionable pointers when necessary during the session. My pair, Kornelius, was patient and kind during our 2 + hours together. I definitely felt very nervous during the hour leading up to it, but my guide and pair were both very accepting of mistakes and questions. Since it was my first ever experience pairing I was excited to learn about pairing norms and am looking forward to putting them in practice in the future.
